# Faster AutoAugment

This is the official *re*implementation of FasterAutoAugment ([hataya2020a](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123700001.pdf).)

## Requirements

* `Python>=3.8`  # Developed on 3.8. It may work with earlier versions.
* `PyTorch==1.5.0` # Required by `kornia`
* `torchvision==0.6.0`
* `kornia==0.3.1`
* `homura==2020.07` # `pip install -U git+https://github.com/moskomule/homura@v2020.07`
* `hydra==0.11` 


## How to Run

Faster AutoAugment is an offline method, so first search then train CNN models.

### Search

```
python search.py [data.name={cifar10,cifar100,svhn}] [...]
```

This script will save the obtained policy at `policy_weight/DATASET_NAME/EPOCH.pt`.

### Train

```
python train.py path=PATH_TO_POLICY_WEIGHT [data.name={cifar10,cifar100,svhn}] [model.name={wrn28_2,wrn40_2,wrn28_10}]  [...]
```

When `path` is not specified, training is executed without policy, which can be used as a baseline.

## Notice

The codebase here is not exactly the same as the one used in the paper. 
For example, this codebase does not include the support for `DistributedDataParallel` and the custom `CutOut` kernel. 
But, we believe this reimplementation is much simpler, more stable, and easier to extend for your research projects.
